Art informs and is informed by technique, specifically, techniques of producing meaning. \n\nTechniques: painting, discourse about experts, signatures, neighborhood appropriation and gentrification, museums, fashion, workplace art, drawing, anti-art, multimedia, "rediscovering" the body, depoliticization, illegality, personality, ambivalence. \n\nAs a factory of meaning, art is continually (re)equipped with the finest machines and the brightest managers. When new technology is released, art slots it in next to last year's model and turns it on. The managers optimize it to run at maximum efficiency.`,

      "We are S.N.I.D.E. We were here before, and we do not plan on going anywhere. We were the fearless pranksters, the disobedient rascals, the mischievous fools. We were the adversary to order before the Order was struck down by Everyday Life. We are not destructive for without a functioning system there will be nothing for us to meddle with. We are not cruel for if we alienate ourselves there will be no one left for us to pester. \n\nDuring this Era of rebirth and rebuilding some want to restructure society: to make it neat and tidy, to make it more organized. We simply strive to make sure that chaos still thrives, whatever the circumstances. Other groups believe that what they are doing has meaning. What we do is devoid of such dogmatic trappings. We understand that every action creates a ripple of effect and consequence, but our concern is not outcomes, only chaos.",

      "The Chrononauts remembered the future. Did they try and divert us from this path, or set us on it? Maybe they just sat back and watched, intrigued by the machinations of time with no desire to change the current of the Everyday. We cannot know for sure; they were, are, and always will be gone.\n\nWithout the Chrononauts, it fell upon us to take up the mantle of stewards and scholars. We, who once focused on transit and travel, journey and destination, have expanded into all dimensions. To perfect the present and ensure a better future, the lessons of the past cannot be forgotten. Sworn to explore the mysteries of time and space, we are the Journeymen. n\nDo not think that we have not learned from the fall of our predecessors. Exploring man's history is pointless if it is not connected to the present. Our mastery of the fourth dimension is tempered by understanding of the first three. We Journey high and low, far and wide, using any method that takes our fancy. Sometimes we set out with purpose and determination, while at others we are led by nothing but idle curiosity. \n\nWe hope our understanding of the world and its ages, of man and his path, can help improve the word in the present. Get out there and explore with us!",

      "Analog welcomes anyone who desires to truly experience the world. The real world, as it was meant to be experienced. Do you long to witness natural wonders with your own eyes? To hear the wind whisper through a forest and smell the scent of pines that it carries? To taste the air on your tongue, and feel the ground beneath your feet? If so, this is the group for you! \n\nThe society that came before us knew little of reality. People obsessed with electronic augmentations that filtered the world through a digital lens. Their perception was influenced by the thoughts and opinions of people they would never meet. If enough people liked something it must be true, no matter what their own senses told them. This digital world was a poor simulation of life, but very few could escape its grasp. \n\nThe weight of the audience crushed creativity and expression and led to the end of Everyday Life. We believe that our future should lie in the physical realm, in structures we can build with our own hands and people we can see eye-to-eye. Technology has its place, and its done wonders for people, but some things must be experienced directly. \n\nThe simulation is over. It's time to live!",
