# World Zero

This is a revamping of the old site <a href="http://sf0.org/" target="_blank">SF0</a>.

SF0 was a collaborative game played in the real world. Users could add tasks for themselves and others to complete to gain points, such as, "Acquire a small potted plant. Leave the plant in a store, cafe, or a location of your choosing that has lack of potted plants." When completing a task, a user would have to supply evidence that they really did it, via photos or other means.

## Live Site

The live site is currently hosted <a href="https://world-zero.vercel.app/">here</a>. I'm adding pages and updates constantly, so check back soon!

Eventually, the site will have a lovely whimsical design I made in Canva, but coding it will be quite unusual and involved. For now it will look very basic to get the essentially functionality and features in place.

## Planned Features

- Fully responsive
- Light/dark mode
- Secure signup + login for users
- Users can join groups
- Users can add other users as friends or foes
- Users can create tasks that others can take on
- All tasks can be searched and filtered
- Users can mark tasks as accomplished to gain points
- Points will grant special privileges
- Users can comment on tasks, task completions, and other users' profiles with rich text, including images in some cases
- When not logged in, home starts with About info; when logged in, shows recent updates for user, such as activity by their friends/foes and comments on their tasks/profile
- Plan to make it screen reader accessible once basic functionality is done

## Standard Next.js Info

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
